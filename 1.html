<h2><a href="https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EB%B9%84%EB%B9%94%EB%B0%A5" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">Bibimbap</a></h2><P> simply translates to <strong>“mixed <u>rice</u> with meat and assorted vegetables“</strong>.
<br>You can make endless variations to this dish depending on your preference and dietary requirements (e.g. microgreens bibimbap)
<br> and also based on the dish/bowl it is served in <br>(e.g. dolsot bibimbap and yangpun bibimbap)</p>

<p style="margin-top:40px">
<p>More traditional and authentic versions of Bibimbap are made with raw beef and raw egg yolk along with other vegetables, but I prefer making mine with cooked ingredients.</p>
So I don’t recall having much nicely presented Bibimbap, like the top picture above at home, yet regardless of the presentation her Bibimbap was always tasty! Anyway, how do you make your bibimbap? Any secret ingredients to share with us?

I hope you enjoy my recipe!
